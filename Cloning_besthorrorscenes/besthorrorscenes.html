                    “Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes I feel are some of 
                    the most affecting in horror. 
                    Some may be simple black cat scares, 
                    others may be more subdued or nuanced. 
                    Many come from films that aren't necessarily 
                    “horror” but have elements or threads of horror.

                Best Horror Scenes is a love letter to the Horror 
                film genre by Brandon Durham. Most film clips contain major spoilers,
                and it is recommended you don’t watch the clip if you plan on seeing the film.

                <p style="color: white;">
                When I discover a film I feel is really special in some way, 
                I usually drag as many people to the theater as possible to 
                see it with me before it’s banished to the streaming realm forever. 
                I’m always excited by the challenge of choosing people 
                I’m sure will enjoy it as much as I do, but I’m not always right.
                <br>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;With <a href="https://besthorrorscenes.com/under-the-skin">Under the Skin (2013)</a>, 
                I had about a 50% success rate with people either really 
                loving it or really hating it. With Let the Right One In (2008), 
                I hit a near 100% success rate with the only complaint being 
                having to read subtitles (which is clearly not a complaint about 
                the movie and says more about the viewer). 
                With Blue Ruin I hit my first home run 
                (did I use that sportsball metaphor correctly?). 
                Now, I’ve only shared it with about 4–5 people, 
                but across the board everyone really loved the movie.
                <br>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Director Jeremy Saulnier needs to write the handbook 
                for making great films on a small budget. 
                The budget for this film was around $420,000, 
                which is just remarkable. I’ve never made a film, 
                but this just seems like an impossible challenge. 
                I’d love to know how they pulled it off. I’m so glad they did.
